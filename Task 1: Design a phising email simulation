One of the most common threats organizations face today is phishing. 
- Phishing is the act of pretending to be someone/something to get information, in most cases, this is usually a password.
- Attackers may send links or attachments designed to infect the recipient's system with malicious software or lure them into providing financial information, system credentials or other sensitive data.
- Successful phishing attempts can cost companies like Mastercard millions of dollars and put our employees at risk. So it’s very important that we keep the business and our staff safe from harm.

One of the ways we mitigate phishing threats is by educating our people about the risks and how to identify them. An effective way to build awareness is through phishing simulation campaigns:
- We test our staff every month by sending a fake phishing email that is made to look like something a bad actor would send.
- We use the results of the simulated test to help us design and implement future training.

- Fixed email spelling and comes froma a relatable source 
- Email is personalized with correct grammar 
- Context to situation 
- Link is masked in plaintext to hide phishing link 
- With regards, to increase legitimacy, buffer text is added 
- At the end, simple confidentiality disclaimer to add legitimacy to email.
